Objective:
Develop an AI-powered system for real-time, autonomous resource management and operations support in LEO and lunar orbit missions.
Problem Statement:
Manual Earth-based monitoring creates latency and operational bottlenecks. Missions like Artemis and Lunar Gateway require onboard autonomy for resource optimization.
ORION-AI Capabilities:
Reinforcement Learning: Smart energy allocation
Predictive Analytics: Forecasts resource needs
Computer Vision: Equipment health checks
Knowledge Graphs: Cross-system semantic reasoning
Key Features:
Autonomous Power Allocation – Optimizes solar/battery use, prioritizes critical systems
Predictive Forecasting – Plans resupply by predicting fuel, oxygen, water usage
Maintenance Assistance – Detects wear/failure early, avoids mission downtime
AI Command Assistant – Suggests actions under safety & ethical boundaries
Use Case:
NASA Lunar Gateway – Predicts life support recalibration → Conserves power → Alerts crew 12 hrs early
System Architecture:
Edge AI onboard spacecraft
Federated learning across missions
Secure satellite-cloud syncing
Compatible with Artemis/Gateway digital twins
Expected Benefits:
30% reduction in downtime
Enhanced safety & crew autonomy
Reduced Earth-comms bandwidth
Scalable from ISS to Mars![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eb38e2e3-bc37-4fb9-9a19-b0ed238399b4)
